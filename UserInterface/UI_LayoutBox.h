*
* SCOPE (Phase 3 -- "caja, unidades y posicionamiento", third increment: "pequeños primero")
*   The roadmap's first Phase 3 bullet is "árbol de layout top-left independiente de las coordenadas de pintura
*   GEN (borde inferior)". This is that tree, and ONLY that tree: a pure geometry data structure (content box +
*   padding/border/margin edges, in CSS's own top-left/+Y-down convention -- see UI_CSSAdapter.h for the existing
*   bridge to GEN's bottom-anchored storage) plus owned parent/child links, with NOTHING behind it yet --
*
*     - it is not built FROM a UI_ELEMENT tree anywhere in this increment (a caller populates it by hand, exactly
*       like the tests below do);
*     - it does not run any layout algorithm (no flow, no percentage resolution, no min/max clamping applied --
*       though UI_COMPUTEDSTYLE::ClampToMinMax()/ResolveContentSize() from the previous increment are exactly
*       the kind of helper a future layout pass would call while filling one of these in);
*     - it does not replace or touch UI_SKINCANVAS::CalculePosition() (UI_Manager.cpp/UI_SkinCanvas.cpp are
*       untouched by this increment);
*     - it is not read by UI_CSSAdapter.h's UI_CSSBox_Get/Set (those still talk directly to UI_ELEMENT).
*
*   That wiring -- actually walking father/compose_elements, actually computing sizes from UI_COMPUTEDSTYLE, and
*   actually driving GEN's rendering through it -- is the fourth (and by far largest) Phase 3 increment: the
*   real UI_LAYOUTENGINE. Until then, UI_LAYOUTBOX exists purely so that increment can be built and tested
*   against a known-correct, already-tested geometry container instead of inventing one under time pressure.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (fourth increment, second sub-step: "position:relative/absolute + insets")
*   Added here: a UI_POSITION tag per box, and a per-edge "specified or not" inset set (UI_LAYOUTBOX_INSETS --
*   NOT reusing UI_LAYOUTBOX_EDGES, because a CSS inset can be legitimately absent/"auto" on any one edge, unlike
*   padding/border/margin which are always numeric). Still pure data: UI_LAYOUTBOX itself applies no positioning
*   math -- that is UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ApplyPositioning()'s job (UI_LayoutEngine.h), reading exactly what is set
*   here. A caller (test, or the engine once wired) populates SetPosition()/SetInsets() by hand; this sub-step
*   still does not read UI_COMPUTEDSTYLE's "position"/"top"/"right"/"bottom"/"left" properties anywhere. The
*   third (and last) sub-step of this increment wires UI_LAYOUTENGINE's output to UI_CSSBox_Set() with the two
*   strategies (legacy/CSS) selectable -- it does NOT add CSS-rule-driven position/insets either: there is
*   currently no per-UI_ELEMENT stored computed style to read them from (GetLayoutElement_Base() in UI_Manager.cpp
*   builds a UI_COMPUTEDSTYLE transiently per XML node at parse time and does not persist it on the element), so
*   making "position:relative" in an actual stylesheet drive an actual UI_ELEMENT remains future work, tracked
*   there rather than promised here.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4 -- "Flexbox/Grid y migración del ejemplo", first increment: "Flexbox básico", first
*   sub-step: data model + single-line main-axis placement via justify-content)
*   Added here: the per-container flex properties (UI_FLEX_DIRECTION, UI_JUSTIFY_CONTENT, row/column gap) and a
*   "is this box a flex container" flag. Pure storage again, same shape as UI_POSITION/UI_LAYOUTBOX_INSETS above
*   -- UI_LAYOUTBOX applies no flex math itself, UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ApplyFlexLayout() does (UI_LayoutEngine.h).
*
*   Deliberately NOT yet covered (later Flexbox sub-steps, same increment):
*
*     - flex-wrap (multi-line) and align-content across lines.
*     - flex-grow/flex-shrink/flex-basis -- every child's CONTENT size is used exactly as already set (its
*       "hypothetical main size" in CSS terms); nothing here grows or shrinks a child to fill/fit the container.
*     - align-items/align-self on the cross axis -- every child is placed at the container's cross-axis START
*       (the CSS flex-start behaviour), regardless of the child's own cross size. Real "stretch"/"center"/etc.
*       cross alignment is later work.
*     - as with UI_POSITION/insets, nothing reads these properties from a real stylesheet -- a caller (test, or
*       a future wiring step) sets SetFlexContainer()/SetFlexDirection()/etc. by hand.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, first increment, second sub-step: "flex-grow/flex-shrink/flex-basis")
*   Added here: the per-ITEM sizing properties -- flex-grow (default 0, CSS initial value), flex-shrink (default
*   1, CSS initial value) and flex-basis (UI_LAYOUTBOX_INSET reused verbatim: "auto", the default, or a resolved
*   value -- exactly the same "specified or not" shape a CSS inset already needed, so no new struct). These are
*   properties of a box AS A FLEX ITEM (how ITS OWN size is resolved by its flex-container PARENT), the mirror
*   image of the previous sub-step's container-side properties. Still pure storage -- UI_LAYOUTENGINE's
*   ArrangeFlexChildren() (UI_LayoutEngine.h) is what reads these to grow/shrink each child's CONTENT main size
*   before packing it, exactly as CSS's flex sizing algorithm does (basis -> hypothetical size -> grow OR shrink
*   the free/negative space across every item, weighted by grow factor or by shrink-factor*base-size).
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, first increment, third sub-step: "flex-wrap + align-content")
*   Added here: two more per-container properties -- UI_FLEX_WRAP (nowrap, the CSS initial value; wrap; or
*   wrap-reverse) and UI_ALIGN_CONTENT (how multiple LINES, not individual items, are distributed across the
*   container's cross axis once wrapping produces more than one). Same shape as every other container property
*   so far: pure storage, defaults to NOWRAP / FLEX_START, interpreted entirely by UI_LAYOUTENGINE.
*
*   UI_ALIGN_CONTENT intentionally has NO "stretch" value (CSS's real initial value for align-content is
*   "normal", which behaves like stretch for a flex container): stretching a LINE only has a visible effect if
*   the ITEMS inside it also stretch to fill it (align-items:stretch), and that per-item cross-sizing does not
*   exist yet (still deferred, see the first sub-step's SCOPE ADDENDUM above) -- so a value this class cannot
*   yet make meaningful is left out rather than added as a silent no-op. UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ArrangeFlexChildren()
*   (UI_LayoutEngine.h) is where this actually applies, once wrapping and align-content land there together.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, first increment, fourth and last sub-step: "align-items + align-self")
*   Added here: UI_ALIGN_ITEMS (per-container: how every child is aligned on the CROSS axis, within its own line)
*   and UI_ALIGN_SELF (per-item: overrides the container's align-items for that one child; AUTO, the default,
*   means "defer to the container"). Unlike UI_ALIGN_CONTENT above, "stretch" IS included here, because this is
*   exactly the per-item cross-sizing that the earlier ADDENDUMs said stretch depends on -- UI_LAYOUTENGINE now
*   resizes a STRETCH-aligned child's cross size to fill its line (see UI_LayoutEngine.h).
*
*   Deliberate deviation from CSS: UI_ALIGN_ITEMS defaults to FLEX_START, not CSS's real initial value ("normal",
*   which behaves as stretch). Every previous Flexbox sub-step's tests already lock in flex-start cross placement
*   as the default (an item keeps its own content size and sits at its line's cross-start unless told otherwise);
*   defaulting to CSS-correct stretch here would silently change every earlier test's and caller's behavior.
*   Callers who want real CSS "normal" behaviour set SetAlignItems(UI_ALIGN_ITEMS_STRETCH) explicitly.
*
*   UI_ALIGN_CONTENT's "stretch" value is still deliberately NOT added even now: it would stretch a LINE's cross
*   size itself (not an item within a fixed-size line, which is what this sub-step does), a distinct and still
*   unimplemented behavior -- tracked as future work, not silently approximated by this sub-step's per-item
*   stretch.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, second increment: "Grid básico", first sub-step: fixed-size tracks (px/%) + gap +
*   row-major auto-placement)
*   Added here: UI_GRID_TRACK_UNIT/UI_GRIDTRACK (one column or row track: a size in pixels or a percentage of the
*   grid container's content size on that axis), a "is this box a grid container" flag, and two per-container
*   track lists (grid-template-columns / grid-template-rows, added one track at a time via
*   AddGridColumnTrack()/AddGridRowTrack()). Row/column GAP reuses the exact same SetGap()/GetRowGap()/
*   GetColumnGap() Flexbox already added above -- CSS's "gap"/"row-gap"/"column-gap" are shared properties, not
*   Flexbox- or Grid-specific, so there is nothing Grid-specific to store for them.
*
*   Pure storage again, same shape as every Flexbox property above -- UI_LAYOUTBOX applies no grid math itself;
*   UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ApplyGridLayout() does (UI_LayoutEngine.h). A caller (test, or a future wiring step) sets
*   SetGridContainer()/AddGridColumnTrack()/etc. by hand; nothing here reads a real stylesheet's
*   grid-template-columns/rows yet.
*
*   Deliberately NOT yet covered (later Grid sub-steps, same increment): `minmax()` track sizing; `grid-column`/
*   `grid-row` spans (every item occupies exactly one cell for now, placed in row-major document order -- CSS
*   calls this "auto-flow: row", the initial value, which is the only flow this sub-step implements); implicit
*   tracks sized by content (if grid-template-rows is empty, UI_LAYOUTENGINE still generates one implicit row
*   per line of content, sized to its tallest item -- see UI_LayoutEngine.h -- but there is no way yet to size
*   an EXPLICIT track by content, only by px/%/fr); justify-items/align-items/justify-self/align-self for grid
*   (every item fills its cell exactly, CSS's real default of "stretch" on both axes -- see UI_LayoutEngine.h
*   for why that default was chosen here).
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, second increment, second sub-step: the `fr` track unit)
*   UI_GRID_TRACK_UNIT gained UI_GRID_TRACK_UNIT_FR: a UI_GRIDTRACK sharing the free space left on its axis
*   after every px/% track (and the axis's gaps) are accounted for, weighted by its own `value` against the sum
*   of every `fr` track's `value` on that same axis -- CSS's real `fr` semantics, and the direct Grid analogue
*   of Flexbox's flex-grow (see UI_LayoutBox.h's Flexbox SCOPE ADDENDUM for that mirror-image property). Still
*   pure storage here: UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ResolveTrackSizesWithFr() (UI_LayoutEngine.h) is what actually computes
*   an `fr` track's share, for both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, second increment, third sub-step: "acotados" minmax() tracks)
*   UI_GRIDTRACK gained a second shape: isminmax == true turns it into a minmax(min, max) bound instead of a
*   single unit/value size -- "min" (minunit/minvalue) is restricted to PX or PERCENT, matching real CSS (a
*   minmax() minimum can never be a <flex>/`fr` value there either); "max" (maxunit/maxvalue) accepts PX,
*   PERCENT, or FR, covering the common "minmax(200px, 1fr)" idiom -- a track that never shrinks below its
*   floor but still grows to absorb free space. There is no builder method for this (unlike the simple-track
*   Add*Track() calls above) -- a caller fills in the fields directly, exactly as the tests below do; the
*   struct's in-class field defaults (see UI_GRIDTRACK itself) mean every EARLIER sub-step's track-building code
*   (which only ever sets "unit"/"value") keeps producing a plain, non-minmax track unchanged.
*
*   How a minmax() track resolves is UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ResolveTrackSizesWithFr()'s job (UI_LayoutEngine.h) --
*   see its own SCOPE ADDENDUM for the exact algorithm and why "min" acting as a reserved floor, with "max"
*   (when `fr`) sharing whatever's left, is the bounded approximation this sub-step deliberately chose over
*   real CSS's iterative, content-aware track sizing algorithm.
*
* SCOPE ADDENDUM (Phase 4, second increment, fourth and last sub-step: "Grid básico" -- grid-column/grid-row
*   spans)
*   Added here: gridcolumnspan/gridrowspan, two per-ITEM properties (a box's own span across each axis, CSS's
*   grid-column/grid-row -- though only the SPAN part; explicit start/end line placement, e.g. "grid-column:
*   2 / 4", is still not covered -- see below), defaulting to 1/1 (CSS's initial value: occupy exactly one
*   cell). Pure storage again, same shape as every other Grid/Flexbox item property above --
*   UI_LAYOUTENGINE::ArrangeGridChildren() (UI_LayoutEngine.h) is what actually auto-places a spanning item
*   across the right number of cells.
*
*   Deliberately still NOT covered, even now that Grid básico's four planned sub-steps are all in: explicit
*   grid-column-start/end / grid-row-start/end line-based placement (this sub-step ONLY changes how big an
*   auto-placed item is, never WHERE it starts -- auto-placement, in row-major document order, remains the only
*   placement algorithm); "auto-flow: column" (row-major only, as since the first sub-step); "dense" packing
*   (CSS can backfill earlier gaps a later, smaller item would fit into -- this engine's placement cursor only
*   ever moves forward, CSS's "sparse" algorithm, the initial value); named grid lines/areas; content-based
*   ("auto") explicit track sizing; justify-items/align-items/justify-self/align-self (still CSS's real default
*   of stretch on both axes for every item, span or not -- see the first sub-step's SCOPE ADDENDUM above).
